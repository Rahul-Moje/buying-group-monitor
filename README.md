## Cloud Deployment (24/7 Operation)

This monitor is designed to run on cloud platforms for 24/7 operation, even when your laptop is off.

### Quick Setup

```bash
# Generate cloud configuration files
python deploy_cloud.py

# Choose your platform:
# 1. Railway (Free tier)
# 2. Render (Free tier)
# 3. Both Railway and Render
```

### Railway Deployment

1. **Sign up** at https://railway.app
2. **Connect** your GitHub repository
3. **Set environment variables** in Railway dashboard:
   - `BUYING_GROUP_USERNAME`
   - `BUYING_GROUP_PASSWORD`
   - `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL`
   - `CHECK_INTERVAL_MINUTES`
4. **Deploy** - Railway will automatically build and run your monitor

### Render Deployment

1. **Sign up** at https://render.com
2. **Connect** your GitHub repository
3. **Set environment variables** in Render dashboard
4. **Deploy** with one click

### Environment Variables for Cloud

Set these in your cloud platform's dashboard:

| Variable | Description | Required |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `BUYING_GROUP_USERNAME` | Your buying group email | ‚úÖ Yes |
| `BUYING_GROUP_PASSWORD` | Your buying group password | ‚úÖ Yes |
| `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` | Discord webhook URL for notifications | ‚ùå No |
| `CHECK_INTERVAL_MINUTES` | How often to check for new deals | ‚ùå No (default: 5) |

## Local Testing

### Test Login Credentials
```bash
python main.py test-login
```

### Run a Single Check
```bash
python main.py check
```

### View Statistics
```bash
python main.py stats
```

### View Commitments
```bash
python main.py list-commitments
```

### Update Commitment
```bash
python main.py update-commitment <deal_id> <new_quantity>
```

## Configuration Options

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `BUYING_GROUP_USERNAME` | Your buying group email | Required |
| `BUYING_GROUP_PASSWORD` | Your buying group password | Required |
| `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` | Discord webhook URL for notifications | Optional |

## How It Works

1. **Authentication**: The monitor logs into your buying group account

## Troubleshooting

### Login Issues
- Verify your credentials in the `.env` file
- Run `python main.py test-login` to test authentication
- Check if the buying group website is accessible

### No Deals Found
- The website structure might have changed
- Check if you're logged in correctly
- Verify the scraper is finding deal cards on the page

### Discord Notifications Not Working
- Verify your Discord webhook URL is correct
- Check if the webhook is still active in Discord
- Ensure the webhook has permission to send messages

### Cloud Deployment Issues
- Check environment variables are set correctly
- Verify the health check endpoint is working (`/health`)
- Check cloud platform logs for errors

### Database Issues
- The database file is created automatically
- If corrupted, delete `buying_group_deals.db` and restart

## Security Notes

- Your credentials are stored securely in cloud environment variables
- Never commit your `.env` file to version control
- The database contains deal information but no sensitive data
- All communication with the buying group website uses HTTPS

## Legal Considerations

- This tool is for personal use only
- Respect the website's terms of service
- Don't overload the server with too frequent requests
- Use responsibly and ethically
