# Buying Group Monitor üöÄ

A Python-based monitoring system for the [Canada Buying Group](https://buyinggroup.ca/) that automatically checks for new deals and sends notifications via Discord.

## Features

- üîç **Automatic Deal Monitoring**: Scrapes the buying group website for new deals
- üìä **Database Storage**: Stores deal information locally using SQLite
- üîî **Discord Notifications**: Sends rich notifications when new deals are found
- ‚è∞ **Scheduled Monitoring**: Runs continuously with configurable intervals
- üìà **Statistics**: Track deal history and statistics
- üîê **Secure Authentication**: Handles login sessions automatically
- ‚òÅÔ∏è **Cloud Deployment**: Run 24/7 on Railway or Render
- ü§ñ **Auto-Commit**: Automatically reserves items for new deals
- üö® **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error notifications with stack traces
- üîÑ **Smart Retry Logic**: Handles minimum quantity requirements automatically

## New Features (2024-06)

- **Auto-Commit with Smart Error Handling**: Automatically reserves items and handles "Must buy X or more" errors with retry logic
- **Discord Error Notifications**: All warnings and errors are sent to Discord with full stack traces for debugging
- **Comprehensive Logging**: All activity is logged to a file (see `LOG_FILE` in `.env`). For Render, use `/tmp/buying_group_monitor.log`.
- **Network Resilience**: Configurable retry logic with exponential backoff for network requests
- **Test Coverage**: Run `python main.py test` to verify all core features work as expected.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Buying Group account credentials
- Discord webhook URL (optional, for notifications)

## Installation

1. **Clone or download this repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd buying-group-monitor
   ```

2. **Install Python dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   # Copy the example file
   cp env_example.txt .env
   
   # Edit .env with your credentials
   nano .env
   ```

4. **Configure your credentials in `.env`**
   ```env
   BUYING_GROUP_USERNAME=your_email@example.com
   BUYING_GROUP_PASSWORD=your_password
   DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL
   CHECK_INTERVAL_MINUTES=5
   AUTO_COMMIT_NEW_DEALS=true
   AUTO_COMMIT_QUANTITY=1
   ```

## Discord Webhook Setup (Optional)

1. Create a Discord server or use an existing one
2. Go to Server Settings > Integrations > Webhooks
3. Create a new webhook
4. Copy the webhook URL and add it to your `.env` file

## Auto-Commit Feature

The monitor can automatically reserve items for new deals:

- **Enabled by default**: Set `AUTO_COMMIT_NEW_DEALS=true`
- **Configurable quantity**: Set `AUTO_COMMIT_QUANTITY=1` (or higher)
- **Smart error handling**: Automatically detects "Must buy X or more" errors and retries with the correct quantity
- **Discord notifications**: You'll get notified of all auto-commit attempts and results

### Auto-Commit Error Handling

When auto-commit encounters a minimum quantity requirement:
1. **First attempt**: Tries with your configured quantity
2. **Error detection**: Parses the error message to find minimum requirement
3. **Retry attempt**: Automatically retries with the correct minimum quantity
4. **Notification**: Sends Discord notification with the result

## Cloud Deployment (24/7 Operation)

This monitor is designed to run on cloud platforms for 24/7 operation, even when your laptop is off.

## How It Works

1. **Authentication**: The monitor logs into your buying group account
2. **Scraping**: It scrapes the dashboard page for current deals
3. **Comparison**: New deals are compared against the local database
4. **Auto-Commit**: If enabled, automatically reserves items for new deals
5. **Error Handling**: Detects and handles minimum quantity requirements
6. **Notifications**: Discord notifications are sent for new deals, errors, and auto-commit results
7. **Storage**: All deal information is stored in SQLite database

## Troubleshooting

### Login Issues
- Verify your credentials in the `.env` file
- Run `python main.py test-login` to test authentication
- Check if the buying group website is accessible

### No Deals Found
- The website structure might have changed
- Check if you're logged in correctly
- Verify the scraper is finding deal cards on the page

### Discord Notifications Not Working
- Verify your Discord webhook URL is correct
- Check if the webhook is still active in Discord
- Ensure the webhook has permission to send messages

### Auto-Commit Issues
- Check Discord for error notifications with stack traces
- Verify minimum quantity requirements are being handled
- Check logs for detailed error information

### Cloud Deployment Issues
- Check environment variables are set correctly
- Verify the health check endpoint is working (`/health`)
- Check cloud platform logs for errors
- Ensure log file path uses `/tmp/` directory

### Database Issues
- The database file is created automatically
- If corrupted, delete `buying_group_deals.db` and restart

## Security Notes

- Your credentials are stored securely in cloud environment variables
- Never commit your `.env` file to version control
- The database contains deal information but no sensitive data
- Debug mode should only be enabled temporarily for troubleshooting

## Legal Considerations

- This tool is for personal use only
- Respect the website's terms of service
- Don't overload the server with too frequent requests
- Use responsibly and ethically

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the troubleshooting section above
2. Verify your configuration is correct
3. Test your login credentials
4. Check if the website structure has changed

## Running Tests

To run all test cases and verify your setup:

```bash
python main.py test
```

All tests should pass. If any fail, check your environment variables and database schema.

## Recommended LOG_FILE for Cloud

For Render or Railway, set:

```
LOG_FILE=/tmp/buying_group_monitor.log
```

in your environment variables dashboard.
